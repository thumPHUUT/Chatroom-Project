This is a final project made for a class. This project focused on socket programming in C, 
and is set up to create a local chatroom on the users terminal. If you wish to edit the program
to work over the net, some modifications are required. I specify where in main these changes can be 
made, but that excercise is left to the reader!

To use, please run the makefile and then an instance of the server and client files in different windows!
